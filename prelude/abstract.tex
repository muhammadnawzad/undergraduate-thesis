As the importance of technology in teaching and learning in the modern university grows, more and more specialized software is being developed for use in this field. One example is the rise in popularity of scheduling and resource management systems among educational institutions. Automating tasks that would otherwise need a lot of time and manual input, such systems help accelerate the scheduling process for both the staff and students. The goal of this project is to automate the previously manual processes at STDC by creating a web-based software with a proper database. Students will be able to verify session availability and book sessions with the help of the system. Furthermore, the system will give students access to any files or lectures that have been submitted by their tutors. The systemâ€™s scheduling method will be beneficial for both students and their designated tutors.
