# Undergraduate Thesis
This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my final year project thesis. The thesis is titled "Student Talent Development Center: Design and Implementation of Scheduling and Resource Management Web Application System". The thesis is written in LaTeX and the source code is available in this repository. The repository also contains the final PDF version of the thesis in both high and low resolution.

## Abstract
As the importance of technology in teaching and learning in the modern university grows, more and more specialized software is being developed for use in this field. One example is the rise in popularity of scheduling and resource management systems among educational institutions. Automating tasks that would otherwise need a lot of time and manual input, such systems help accelerate the scheduling process for both the staff and students. The goal of this project is to automate the previously manual processes at Student Talent Development Center (STDC) of University of Kurdistan Hewlêr (UKH) by creating a web-based software with a proper database. Students will be able to verify session availability and book sessions with the help of the system. Furthermore, the system will give students access to any files or lectures that have been submitted by their tutors. The system’s scheduling method will be beneficial for both students and their designated tutors.

## How to Compile
The thesis is written in LaTeX and in order to compile the thesis, you need to have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system. I recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). You can compile the thesis by importing the project into Overleaf and then clicking on the "Recompile" button. Alternatively, you can compile the thesis on your local machine by using the any LaTeX distribution.

## How to Use
This thesis is an implementation of the [ukh-undergraduate-thesis-latex-template](https://github.com/muhammadnawzad/ukh-undergraduate-thesis-latex-template) LaTeX template. The template is designed to be used by undergraduate students at University of Kurdistan Hewlêr (UKH) for their final year project thesis. The template is designed to be as simple as possible and it is very easy to use. The template is also very flexible and can be used for any type of thesis.

The content of the thesis is a product of my own work and the work of my supervisor. Time constraints and the scope of the project did not allow for a more thorough research and implementation. Therefore, small mistakes and errors may be present in the thesis. If you find any mistakes or errors, understand that everything was done in 9 months and I did not have the time to go through the thesis multiple times or have it reviewed.

The implementation of the system is not included in this repository. The implementation of the backend is available at [stdc-api](https://github.com/muhammadnawzad/stdc-api) and the implementation of the frontend is available at [stdc-client](https://github.com/muhammadnawzad/stdc-client). These repositories are private and you will not be able to access them as of now since the code quality is not good enough for public release. However, I will be releasing the code in the future after I have refactored the code and improved the code quality if I have the time.
