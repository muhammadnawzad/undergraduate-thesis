\chapter{Analysis and Design}

\begin{justify}
    This chapter focuses on the Analysis and Design phase of the software development process. The planning phase, analysis phase, and design phase are all integral parts of this chapter,  all of which will be explored in more depth during the course of this chapter. The planning phase establishes the objectives and assesses the risks of the project, while the analysis phase identifies the requirements and constraints of the system, both functional and non-functional. The design phase then takes these requirements and creates a blueprint for the final product. The aim of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive overview of the Analysis and Design phase, highlighting the importance of these phases in the software development process and the critical role they play in the successful completion of the project.\\
